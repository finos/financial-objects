The Financial Objects Program, launched in July 2018, was formed to drive adoption of new and existing Financial Object Standards across the Financial Services Industry, through a FINOS Program that brings together creators of Financial Objects with users of Financial Objects. Standardization of Financial Objects is valuable to the Financial Services industry because it will lower integration and transaction costs, simplify processing across organizational boundaries, enable the mutualization of commodity software for handling these objects, and improve the discoverability of data and overall interpretability and readiness for data analysis tools.

(TODO) - say something about the FO Working Group.

Financial Objects is hosted within, and governed by the policies of, the Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS). FINOS is an independent nonprofit organization focused on promoting open innovation within financial services.
